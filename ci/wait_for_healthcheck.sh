# Waiting for a running container to become healthy.
# Waits if no container was found with reason "no such object".
# Waits for the container configured healthcheck.
# Fails if this script runs for too long with the reason "Killed by timeout".
#
# Usage example:
# ./tools/wait_for_healthcheck.sh mongooseim-riak
# or
# ./tools/wait_for_healthcheck.sh "$CONTAINER"
#
# TIMEOUT argument documentation
# ------------------------------
#
# TIMEOUT is number of times we try to get healthcheck status.
# Because we wait one second between tries, it can be interpreted as
# number of seconds we wait.
#
# with 5 seconds timeout:
# TIMEOUT=5 ./tools/wait_for_healthcheck.sh "$CONTAINER"
#
# If call to docker daemon gets blocked for a long time
# (for example, if docker daemon is down),
# that TIMEOUT would not work as expected.
#
# If "docker inspect" takes some time to execute, than TIMEOUT does not work
# as expected.
#
# This command always fails:
# TIMEOUT=0 ./tools/wait_for_healthcheck.sh "$CONTAINER"
#
# This command would try to get healthcheck status once:
# TIMEOUT=1 ./tools/wait_for_healthcheck.sh "$CONTAINER"
